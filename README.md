## Capstone project
# Project Overview
This project showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization using PowerBI. The dataset used includes sales orders, and I leveraged parameters, calculated fields, and visualizations to extract actionable insights and demonstrate business intelligence (BI) competencies. The project focuses on delivering clear, interactive visualizations that help to uncover trends, comparisons, and patterns in sales performance across different dimensions.

# Key Features
Dynamic Parameter Control: Users can toggle between different sales metrics such as revenue and quantity sold, providing flexibility in data analysis.
Time Series Analysis: I have implemented a comparison between sales performance across different years, highlighting sales trends over time.
Sales Breakdown by Category: Visualized sales performance at different levels, such as product categories, regions, and time.

# Skills Demonstrated
PowerBI Features: Dynamic Parameters, Calculated Fields, Interactive Filters, and Drill-Downs.
Data Analysis: Analyzed year-over-year sales performance, identifying key trends and outliers.
Business Intelligence: Developed insights that can drive business decisions, such as identifying top-performing products and regions.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to work with complex datasets, create dynamic visualizations, and extract insights to support business decision-making. By applying advanced PowerBI functionalities, I have showcased my skills in business intelligence and data visualization. Feel free to explore the PowerBI reports and PowerPoint slides to see the analysis in action.
